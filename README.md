## Learning Objective
My first project writing JavaScript code and it was tough because it's a dynamically typed language. The hardest part for me was learning all the methods that comes with JavaScript and knowing how to use it. 

I deepened my understanding of manipulating the DOM by ensuring that I get references to nodes and adding event listeners to each node. 

I practiced writing clean code by seperating my functions, getting references, and event listeners. For future projects I have multiple JavaScript files for modularity.
